# Small demo project during a lecture in JU

I requrested some sample projects to do to show how git works.

`calc.py` is me cheating and using python built in eval function to implement a calculator.

`guess.py` is a simple guessing game.

`battleships.py` is what you expecte. Did not have time to finish it during the lecture. But it was fun so I wanted to improve it a bit afterwards.

It now generates a resonable initial hidden board for the computer that you need to guess.

You will **not** have any ships. So it is a one-sided game, you trying to find the computers ships only.

Example how the game looks like:

    You have 1 guesses left
    Guess a coodinate, eg 5 3 or q to quit
    4 3
    hit!
    O~~~~~~~~~
    ~O~~~~~O~O
    ~~O~~~O~O~
    ~~~O####O~
    ~~~~O~O~~~
    ~~~~~O~~~~
    ~O~~~~O~O~
    ~~~~~~~O#~
    ~~~~~~~~#~
    ~O~~~~~~OO
    You have 1 guesses left
    Guess a coodinate, eg 5 3 or q to quit
    2 7
    miss!
    O~~~~~~~~~
    ~O~~~~~O~O
    ~~O~~~O~O~
    ~~~O####O~
    ~~~~O~O~~~
    ~~~~~O~~~~
    ~O~~~~O~O~
    ~~O~~~~O#~
    ~~~~~~~~#~
    ~O~~~~~~OO
