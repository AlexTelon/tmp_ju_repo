# Small demo project during a lecture in JU

I requrested some sample projects to do to show how git works.

`calc.py` is me cheating and using python built in eval function to implement a calculator.

`guess.py` is a simple guessing game.

`battleships.py` is what you expecte. Did not have time to finish it during the lecture. But it was fun so I wanted to improve it a bit afterwards.

It now generates a resonable initial board for the computer.

    $ python battleships.py
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    XXXX~~~~~~

    ~~~~~X~X~~
